# Shut the box

'Shut the box' is a simple math and luck based game, where the objective is to close all the numerated 'doors' in a 'box'. It was made for the porpuse of learning C++ and practicing good Software Engineering and OOP practices. I focused on:
- Clear separation of concerns between classes
- Good encapsulation of game logic
- Usage of the C++ standart library

## How to play
Just run the executable, and use the keyboard to navigate the menu and to input choices.
